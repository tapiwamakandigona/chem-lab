## iter-14 (2026-08-11)
- Extracted generic `src/components/scene/DragTipper.jsx` from ClockScene's PourableBeaker (home/target/enabled/onPour/onModeChange, drop ring, grab cylinder, tilt+stream anim, spring-home, OrbitControls disable via useThree((s)=>s.get)). ClockScene refactored onto it; pour.py still exit 0. VERIFIED
- F12: EnthalpyScene DraggableBoat via DragTipper — boat on balance pan (home 0.305,BENCH_Y+0.056,0.011), drop on calorimeter mouth (-0.08,BENCH_Y+0.132,0.04) tips boat with white powder stream and calls enthalpyStart; balance reads 0.00 while lifted (boatAway via onModeChange); lid renders only after setup phase. VERIFIED via probe/tip.py exit 0 + tip-drag.png/tip-stream.png inspected.
- Bug fixed (parallax): lifted drag plane means object position != pointer aim at bench level; drop test now uses e.ray.intersectPlane at target height. Before fix POUR still 0 (clock plane is at bench height), TIP failed; after fix both 0.
- Bug fixed (probe): tip.py fixed sleeps outlasted 5 s enthalpy run under SwiftShader (saw 'complete', asserted 'Running'). Rewrote to poll <=12 s for evidence-of-start (Running OR T2>22.0), screenshot at first detection.
- Full regression: titrate/clock/enthalpy/offline/meniscus/meniscus_mobile/pour/tip = 0, shot.py iter14 = 0. Shots iter14-enthalpy.png (open calorimeter, boat on balance) and iter14-clock.png inspected. VERIFIED
